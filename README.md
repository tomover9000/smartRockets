# smartRockets
It's a basic genetic algorithm implementation that i made as an exercise
The rockets must "learn" how to avoid the block in front of them and to make it to the target.
It takes a couple of generations to reach the target, also sometimes they all try to go down because of the randomness of the solution.

The program is written in javascript and i used the p5.js library to visualize the solution.

There is an inputbox to change the width of the block (it's easier for the rockets to cross a smaller block).
